            <p className="mt-3">
              Taskora is a project management application for organizing
              workspaces, projects, and tasks. It is operated as a portfolio
              project. Features may change, and the service may be paused or
              discontinued.

              You keep ownership of the workspaces, projects, tasks, and
              comments you create. Everything in a workspace is visible to all
              of its members, including names and email addresses. Workspace
              owners decide who to invite, and invited members can see every
              project in that workspace.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              By adding content, you allow Taskora to store it and show it to
              the members of the workspace it belongs to, which is necessary to
              run the service.
